## /Shaders

This directory contains code and files for Beyond Material, our newest design language for lambdaOS. 

Most of Beyond Material's rendering code are built off from GLSL shaders, and bindings for LambdaGraphics integration, written in C++. Due to high GPU acceleration, we require shaders for our new design language to render and draw properly.
